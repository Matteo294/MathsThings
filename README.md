# MathsThings
I use this repository to write some mathematical things (proofs, derivations, precisations) useful in physics.  
The approach will be rather intuitive rather than technical and the main goal is to have a place where to store useful concepts, so that they can be fastly recovered.  
In this moment I am focusing on Lie group theory and some differential geometry.  
  
 ## pushpull
 Definition of the pull-back of a differential form and push-forward of a vector between two manifolds.  
 Definition of integral curves and flows of a vector field on a manifold.
 Definition of Lie derivatives.
